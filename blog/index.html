  <h3>Adding leading zeros with Python</h3>
<p>Various ways to add leading zeros to a number, for instance a wind direction, using Python.</p>
<h3>Generate a list of wind directions</h3>
<p>First some definitions. The wind direction is measured in degrees clockwise from north and represents the direction the wind is blowing <strong>from</strong>. For instance an easterly wind, ie wind blowing <strong>from</strong> the east has a direction of 90 degrees. Let's generate 16 wind directions from 0 (north) to 337.5 (north by northwest).</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">interval</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">22.5</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="mi">360</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">interval</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mf">0.001</span>

<pre><code>[0.0, 22.5, 45.0, 67.5, 90.0, 112.5, 135.0, 157.5, 180.0, 202.5, 225.0, 247.5, 270.0, 292.5, 315.0, 337.5]
</code></pre>
<h3>String zfill method</h3>
<p>No doubt the most pythonic way to add leading zeros to a bare string, the built-in <code>str.zfill()</code> method is designed to do just that.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="nb">dir</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">directions</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">dir</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">zfill</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">dir</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">zfill</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
<pre><code>000 000.0
022 022.5
045 045.0
067 067.5
090 090.0

135 135.0
157 157.5
180 180.0
202 202.5
225 225.0

270 270.0

315 315.0
337 337.5
</code></pre>
<p>We can immediately see our first quirk: the integer representation truncates decimal values rather than rounding up (as I learned to do at school) or rounding towards the nearest even number (as the Python round() funtion would do).</p>
<h3>String slicing</h3>
<p>Very fast and arguably even more readable for people with a good understanding of basic python syntax but no desire to read the docs or explore the obscure corners of the language. Add the maximum possible number of leading zeros and then slice the desired number of digits.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="nb">dir</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">directions</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;00&#39;</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">dir</span><span class="p">))[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">:])</span>

<h3>String format : integers</h3>
<p>As part of a longer string this allows the  number to be inserted with leading zeros. Compatible with all current versions of Python.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="nb">dir</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">directions</span><span class="p">:</span>

</pre></div>

<h3>F Strings</h3>
<p>From Python 3.6 this is even terser.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="nb">dir</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">directions</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="s1">&#39;As integer: {int(dir):03d}  |  As float: {dir:05.1f}&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<pre><code>As integer: 000  |  As float: 000.0
As integer: 022  |  As float: 022.5

As integer: 315  |  As float: 315.0
As integer: 337  |  As float: 337.5

<h3>Class</h3>
<p>By overloading the built-in <code>__str__()</code> method for the class we can create our own custom string representation of the value.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">WindRecord</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">):</span>

  <p>I have had a few ideas for content to share recently and wanted a good way to do so.  I wanted to find a good solution for blog publishing with a few criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built using Python, editable in markdown so I can develop my skills.</li>
<li>Simple to build and maintain - I am not a web developer and have no desire to become one.  That said, I have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010520155249/http://www.fortunecity.co.uk/madchester/latin/336/">building websites</a> on an amateur basis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202092552/http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/union/susoc/ftc/">since the 1990s</a> so I'm not afraid of writing a little html if I have to.</li>
<li>Capable of incorporating Jupyter Notebooks</li>
<li>Simple to deploy, preferably for free.  I am hoping to do this via my internet provider but might go via GitHub failing that or even pay for a small cloud server.</li>
<li>No initial need for interractive content.</li>
</ul>
<p>I saw that the static site generators Pelican and Lektor were available.  That sounds like a good solution as it should be quick and have few moving parts which could break.  <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a> looked simple, welcoming and modern enough so I downloaded and installed it. I listened to <a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/embed_details/160">Talk Python episode 160</a> as I did so and that encouraged me that I was on a good path.</p>

</iframe><p>My initial experience has been great - I got going with no problem except that at the time of writing I have been waiting over a week for free to get around to setting up my personal web space so I can deploy the site.  At least that has given me enough time to configure a basic blog and write my first 2 posts.</p>
